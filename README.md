# React + TypeScript + Vite

![Project demo](https://i.imgur.com/80LNauX.gif)

Guitar e-commerce catalog, with favorites modal, products comparison section, search filtering and product detail pages.
The search bar is optimized with a debounce function for better UX, and the favorites list is kept in browserStorage.
I developed this front-end app with TypeScript & React, using Tailwind for styling.
